Are you frustrated with your political party not passing their stated agenda?
Are you thinking of sitting out this election?

Before you do, answer the following questions:

* What are your policy goals?

* Did legislation related to those policy goals come to a vote in Congress?

* If so, did your Representative or Senator vote in favor of those policy goals?

* Did the legislation pass?

Suppose you answered "yes" to the second and third questions, but "no" to the
fourth question.  In other words, your Representative or Senator did what they
could to pass legislation that you support, but ultimately that legislation did
not pass because of other Representatives or Senators.

Would it make sense to withdraw support for your Congressperson for voting the
way you hoped that they would vote?

Vice versa, suppose that you answered "no" to the third question.  In other
words, your Representative or Senator opposed legislation that you supported.

Would it make sense to sit out the election when the person that represents you
is actively undermining your legislative goals?

Either way, abstaining from the election makes your Congressperson less likely
to fulfill your legislative goals.  You might be frustrated that other
Representatives or Senators from the same party or the opposing party are not
on the same page as you, but they do not have a duty to represent you.
