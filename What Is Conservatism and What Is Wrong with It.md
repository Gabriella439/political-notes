'What is Conservatism and What is Wrong with It?' is a political essay that
positions conservatism as opposed to democracy:

* [What is Conservatism and What is Wrong with It?](https://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/agre/conservatism.html)

This essay articulates why we need to protect democracy (or, more generally,
majoritarianism) and oppose conservatism (or, more generally, minoritarianism).
Moreover, the essay supports this thesis with several historical examples.

You'll most likely find this essay useful if:

* you want to make the case against conservatism *per se*

  … as opposed to simply arguing against specific conservative policies.  As the
  title suggests, the essay attempts to identify the ideological core of
  conservatism and directly assault that core.

* you're interested in punditry

  … as opposed to simply civic journalism.  The essay catalogs in detail many
  conservative strategies for public relations and offers advice targeted
  towards aspiring pundits.

The essay attempts to propose specific solutions to oppose conservatism in the
final section.  However, unlike [[The Authoritarians]], these proposed solutions
are not supported by social science research.
