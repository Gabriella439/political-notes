I sometimes hear people complain about the Democrats' lack of organization or
messaging on social media.  My response to that is: you *are* the Democrats.

If you're waiting for some cavalry to show up to save the day, then I've got
news for you: you *are* the cavalry.

So if you think Democrats need better messaging, then start crafting and
spreading a message that will resonate with voters.  Similarly, if you think
Democrats are bad at organizing then roll up your sleeves and start organizing.

However, if you're waiting for politicians to fix the party then you'll die
holding your breath.  Politicians can only react to pressure at the grassroots
level; your job is to be the change that they react to.
